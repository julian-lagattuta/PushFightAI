# PushFightAI

I attempted to make AlphaZero for the board game PushFight. The code implements Monte Carlo Tree Search for a game that is not easy to do traditional Monte Carlo Tree Search with because of the wide range of possible moves in one single turn. Instead of the tree swapping between both players, each turn is split into three stages. There is an attempt at using Machine Learning; however, the complexity of the code became a huge burden and I had already spent too much time on the project to keep going.
