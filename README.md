# PushFightAI

This was an attempted implementation of the AlphaZero* AI algorithm for the board game PushFight. Itâ€™s particularly difficult to implement a traditional Monte Carlo Tree Search for PushFight because of the wide range of possible moves in one single turn. Instead of the tree swapping between both players, each turn is split into three stages. There is an attempt here to use machine learning; however, the complexity of the code became a huge burden and I had already spent too much time on the project, so I stopped working on it.
